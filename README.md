# GiveMoney Bank
Simple prototype of a website for a bank using MVC.

Functionalities include creating accounts, logging in, creating transactions, creating and deleting messages.
Most of the functionality requires authorization and creating messages in particular needs the user to be an admin.
This admin role is seeded at the start if it does not exist.

For testing purposes every account starts with 1000 (Kr) when created, and it is easy for anyone to become an admin upon registration.
